## Question 6
One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With -I IO_RUN_LATER, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather,whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

### Answer
The system resources are **not** being effectively utilized. The RUN_LATER flag causes the CPU to start another CPU process instead of switching to the process that just finished its I/O operation. 
This enqueues I/O requests at the end of the processesm list, making the CPU stay IDLE while waiting for the I/O requests to complete. 

``` shell
py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER
```

```
py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER
