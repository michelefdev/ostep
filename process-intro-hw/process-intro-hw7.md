## Question 7
Now run the same processes, but with -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?


### Answer
This flag forces the CPU to immediately run the process that issued the I/O, so that process can terminate (RUN:io_done).
Since we passed a list of **three processes** that need I/O, the second one starts right after, initiates the I/O, and while being BLOCKED doing I/O, the CPU can continue working on other processes. So instead of enqueing all the I/O operations one after another (like in the previous question), the I/O operations are interleaved with the CPU operations, leading to improved CPU utilization.
